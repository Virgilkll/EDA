# EDA
Exploratory Data Analysis
This assignment aims to give an idea of applying EDA in a real business scenario. In this assignment, apart from applying the techniques that I have learnt in the EDA module, I will also develop a basic understanding of risk analytics in banking and financial services and show how data is used to minimise the risk of losing money while lending to customers.
